per window:
  queue
  per camera:
    swapchain target, overlay
    semaphore sc, sco, draw
    cmdbuffer
    aquire swapchain, signal sc
    per shader:
      pipeline
      per renderer:
        if on camera's layer
	  add render to cmdbuffer
    create and return submitinfo for cmdbuffer, waiting on sc, signal draw
    aquire overlay, signal sco, clear, store for later rendering
  swapchain main, overlay
  semaphore sc, sco
  create buffer and submitinfo for main aquire main, signal sc
  create buffer and submitinfo for blit, waiting on sc and camera submits, signal fence
  execute all submitinfos
  fence
  aquire overlay, signal sco, clear, store for later rendering
  wait for fence
